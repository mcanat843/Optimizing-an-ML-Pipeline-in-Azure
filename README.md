# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
-This dataset contains data about both current and retired employees of a marketing department of a bank. The process created seeks to predict the accuracy of the Y column of the Tabular
Data Set.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
- The best performing model should be the one that uses automl. Although some errors on the prebuilt code was corrected, there are still errors that I can't seem to find the right solutions.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
-The dataset contains the details of the employees of a marketinf department of a bank. The hyperparameter tuning and classification algorithm was set to 10 percent tolerance to have 
a better precision on the overall process.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
-The main benefit of the random parameter sampling I have set is to have a more precise results because I set it only to plus or minus 10 percent on both the '--C' and '--max_iter'.

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
-The early termination policy will terminate the job if the primary metric falls outside of the top 10 percent in every 2 iterations to make sure that the process won't take too long 
and use up a lot of resources in trying to find out what the optimal parameter is.

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
-The AutoML experiment has a 30 minutes timeout and has a task named Accuracy. The primary metric used is AUC_Weighted and the training data is the from the variable y_train which is from
the column y of the dataset. The AutoML run has 5 n cross validations.

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**
- The Azure AutoML run is more accurate than the one using Python SDK with provided Scikit-learn model. Because the run with AutoML sets a better parameter than those of the Python SDK.

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
-Build and sort the dataset according to criteria so that one can easily identify how many are the possible element are there in each criteria.
